   - Validates if the file contains a valid page ID in `<csp:parameters>`
   - Verifies Confluence connectivity

2. **Content Comparison**

     - Downloads and converts published content
     - Updates local file while preserving CSP structure
   - If updating Confluence:
     - Converts local content to Confluence format
     - Updates the page via REST API
     - Syncs all metadata, properties and images

5. **User Feedback**
